<h1>About Me</h>
<p>Hi, I'm a student and this is a basic website. I am in high school, and I like computer programming. I would like to maintain my 4.0 unweighted GPA throughout high school. Subjects I like at school include AP Computer Science Principles, math, and Spanish. I am looking for internships in the areas of Cyber Security and AI. Please let me know if you have any.</p>
<h2>What I like<h2>
<p>I like to play chess, and I like the Acura NSX car. Chess is a good way to kill time and use your brain. It requires thinking while having fun at the same time. The Acura NSX is a pretty clean car, sleek and modern. However, the price tag makes you rather want to buy a Tesla instead. <p>
